<hr>
<p>This contains the source code for a small website that I've made, which enables the users to search, add and host camping sites!</p>
<p>CampVerse is a full scale deployed website which has a user friendly interface that will enable you to explore the best options for your next <b>camp!</b> I have made the use of some of the most prominent and versatile tools out there to make it as user friendly as possible. From giving you reviews about the place that users have previously stayed to showing you the exact location of the campground on map in satellite view, it gives you every tiny bit of detail that you can use to find the best camping ground as per your need!</p>
<p>Be it going on a small family vacation, or a college friend-reunion, we've got you covered! You are just a few clicks away from your adventurous camping experience.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<div>
  <p>This is my first hands-on experience with a full scale website creation, the main motive of this website for me was to learn the concepts of web development from the perspective of a full scale web developer. It's been one hell of an experience for me to control the frontend and backend of this website and watch it all working together in sync! There are a lot of modifications that I need to make on this website. It's just a kid and it will keep on evolving with time! I'll keep on adding new features and work on the UI, which is not really so great at the moment.</p>
